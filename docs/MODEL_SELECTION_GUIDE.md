| `small` | 4GB | 4+ cores | 7x realtime | **Production** |
| `medium` | 8GB | 8+ cores | 3x realtime | High-quality |
| `turbo` | 4GB | 4+ cores | 4x realtime | Optimized |

### Performance Factors

#### ‚úÖ **Optimal Performance Conditions**
- Dedicated system resources
- SSD storage for model loading
- Adequate RAM (2x model size minimum)
- No concurrent heavy processes

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Impact Factors**
- **Concurrent processes**: Other AI agents, video encoding, etc.
- **System load**: High CPU/memory usage from other applications
- **Storage speed**: HDD vs SSD affects model loading time
- **Language detection**: Auto-detection adds ~10-20% overhead

### Real-World Performance Notes

Based on benchmark testing:
- **`large-v3` sensitivity**: Performance dropped from expected ~15s to 144s when system was under load
- **Concurrent processing**: Running multiple AI agents significantly impacts large model performance
- **Memory efficiency**: All models used <2GB RAM, well within system limits
- **Consistent small models**: `tiny`, `base`, `small` showed consistent performance regardless of load

## üåç Language-Specific Considerations

### English Optimization
All models are optimized for English by default:
```bash
# Explicit English (recommended)
python transcribe.py audio.mp4 --language en --model small

# Auto-detection (slower)
python transcribe.py audio.mp4 --language auto --model small
```

### Multilingual Models
- **All models support**: 99+ languages
- **Performance impact**: Non-English content may be 10-15% slower
- **Quality**: English models (`small.en`, `base.en`) available for English-only optimization

### Language-Specific Recommendations

| Content Type | Model | Language Setting | Performance |
|--------------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **English podcasts** | `small` | `--language en` | Optimal |
| **English meetings** | `medium` | `--language en` | High quality |
| **Spanish content** | `small` | `--language es` | Good |
| **Mixed languages** | `medium` | `--language auto` | Variable |
| **Unknown language** | `small` | `--language auto` | Slower |

## üîß Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. **Model Selection Strategy**
```bash
# Development workflow
for audio in test_files/*.mp4; do
    python clean_transcribe.py "$audio" --dev --model base
done

# Production workflow  
for audio in production/*.mp4; do
    python clean_transcribe.py "$audio" --model small
done
```

### 2. **System Optimization**
```bash
# Check system resources before large batches
free -h
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -5

# Close unnecessary applications for large model processing
python clean_transcribe.py important.mp4 --model medium
```

### 3. **Batch Processing Optimization**
```bash
# Sequential processing (recommended)
for file in batch/*.mp4; do
    echo "Processing: $file"
    python clean_transcribe.py "$file" --model small
    sleep 2  # Brief pause between files
done

# Memory cleanup between large files
python -c "import gc; gc.collect()" && python clean_transcribe.py large_file.mp4 --model medium
```
